# Unofficial Prusa Mini/+ LCD support

This repo uses [Matthew Lloyd](https://github.com/matthewlloyd)'s work to support Prusa Mini's screen in Klipper. Unfortunatelly Matthew Lloyd removed his repo but some users like [Rafa≈Ç Matysiak](https://github.com/Pravv) managed to save his work. I forked this repo to try and keep his work around - I am not planning to update it in any way, just maybe keep it up to date with Klipper master (hopefully no breaking changes).
