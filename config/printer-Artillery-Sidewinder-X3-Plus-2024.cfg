# For the Artillery Sidewinder X3 Pro/Plus that came factory installed with V1.29 firmware, follow these steps.
#   - Compile with the processor model STM32F401.
#   - Select the 48KiB bootloader,
#   - Select USB PA11/PA12 for USB communication interface.
#   - Select USART2 PA3/PA2 for UART communication via the Wi-Fi Tx/Rx pins
# To set 48KiB bootloader, you need to make a change to make menuconfig Kconfig file
# Here is a link to a how-to video: https://youtu.be/dpc76zN7Dh0
# Rename klipper.bin to yuntu.bin
# Copy the file out/yuntu.bin to an SD card and then restart the printer with that SD card
#
# For models that did not come with V1.29 installed
#   - Compile with the processor model STM32F401.
#   - Select the NO BOOTLOADER
#   - Select USB PA11/PA12 for USB communication interface.
#   - Select USART2 PA3/PA2 for UART communication via the Wi-Fi Tx/Rx pins
#   - quit, save, make
#   - Connect your printer to a computer running Pronterface, Octoprint, Repetier, BedLeveler5000 (anything with Console capability)
#   - Power on the machine and send M997 through console into Marlin, this will put the board into "DFU" mode
#   - DO NOT TURN OFF THE PRINTER
#   - Connect your Linux/Klipper device to the USB port
#   - Run lsusb and verify that the STM32 DFU device is visible (Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode)
#   - Run sudo make flash 0483:df11
#   - Run lsusb again and there should be two devices:
#        Bus 001 Device 007: ID 1d50:614e OpenMoko, Inc. stm32f401xc
#        Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0cf3:e010 Qualcomm Atheros Communications stm32f401xc
# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2, 2
#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
algorithm: bicubic
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.
