# This file contains common pin mappings for the Monoprice
# Select Mini v1. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32F103 microcontroller with an 8MHz crystal and USB for communication.
#
# Use the following settings in make menuconfig:
#
#  * Enable extra low-level configuration options: Enable
#  * Microcontroller architecture: STM32
#  * Processor: STM32F103
#  * Bootloader offset: 8KiB bootloader
#  * Clockspeed: 8 Mhz crystal
#  * Communication interface: USB (on PA11/PA12)
#  * GPIO pins to set: PA8, PB1, PB5, PB9
#
#  IMPORTANT: A bootloader offset of 8KiB will preserver the stock bootloader
#  and allows easy flashing via SDCard without additional hardware.
#
#  IMPORTANT: Setting PB9 in the the GPIO pins to set at micro-controller
#  startup is required for the USB port to function. 
#
#  PA8, PB1, PB5 in the GPIO pins deactivates the steppers until klippy
#  takes over.
#
# Note 1: Prior to flashing klipper, if possible, make a copy of the default
# or current configuration values for your printer.  Running an M503 command
# will output these values.
#
# Note 2: You can flash klipper by copying out/klipper.bin to the MPSMv1's
# SDCard, renaming it to update.bin, and creating an empty file on the SD card
# named fcupdate.flg.  Insert the SDCard while the printer is off it on.  After
# klipper is flashed, remove the SDCard and delete update.bin and fcupdate.flg
# to prevent the firmware from flashing on every subsequent power-on. 
# Returning to stock firmware without a programmer is possible as long as you
# do not overwrite the bootloader.
#
# Note 3: Stepper directions are not consistent in MSPMv1 printers. Check the
# directions of your device with M503 in the stock firmware and adjust the
# dir_pins below accordingly.
#
# Note 4: Klipper currently does not support the LCD-UI of this
# printer, which is connected via serial interface and controlled by an
# esp8266 using a custom protocol. But it is possible to use the original
# rotary encoder & button with an extra display. An example of how to attach
# a SSD1306 OLED display is commented out at the bottom.
#
# See ../docs/Config_Reference.md file for a description of all parameters.

# Later motion controllers have a unused socket that can be used to
# attach a probe or other additional hardware.
# You will need a JST PH 4-pin connector. Pin order (from STM32 to
# SDCard-slot) is: GND-PA2-PA3-3.3V
#
# Older BLtouch sensors and knock offs require 5V supply voltage.
# Since the motion controller does not supply 5V you will need to add
# an appropriate power source. easiest is probably soldering a 5V step
# down converter to the 12V supply pins. When running the touch sensor
# on 5V you will also need reduce the voltage on the sensor_pin with a
# voltage divider or level shifter. The control_pin can be attached to
# a 5V touch sensor directly.
