# This file contains common pin mappings for the Anycubic
# Mega Zero V1. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# AVR atmega1284p.

# Note the max and min position are taken from the stock firmware
# and you are free to change it to something more normal such as 235

# Both the Mega Zero V1 and V2 have a Bondtech BMG extruder clone which uses a double gear setup.
# Extruder rotation distance will be much smaller than other printers with single geared extruders (e.g., Creality Ender 3)

# If you are using the Bigtreetech SKR Mini MZ V1.0 Motherboard (Bigtreetech's direct upgrade motherboard for the Mega Zero series)
# you will need to use the dedicated configuration file in the config directory

# See docs/Config_Reference.amd for a description of parameters.

# The print bed can move so far to the front, that the nozzle can reach the
# plastic cover of the print bed heater cable (only when the bed is moved by
# hand). By homing the Y axis before the X axis, it is ensured the nozzle will
# not melt through the plastic part.
# BEWARE: You will lose the ability to home axes individually. The printer will
# always home all axes for every G28 command.
