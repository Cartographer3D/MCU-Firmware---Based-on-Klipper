Installation: 
See [installation](Installation.md) for information on compiling,
installing, and running Klipper.

Configuration: 
To configure Klipper for your printer, first take a look at the example configuration (.cfg) files in the [config](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/tree/master/config) directory.  
[example.cfg](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/config/example.cfg) provides the documentation for each configuration parameter. Other example config files have already been created for common printer types.  Choose the .cfg that is the closest match for your printer, and edit it accordingly.  Note: this is the most important part of the process, be sure to take your time in editing the configuration file to match your printer's specifications.

Advanced Configuration: 
See [firmware commands](Firmware_Commands.md) for a high-level description of commands implemented in the firmware.  This will be useful for advanced printer configuration for developers.
