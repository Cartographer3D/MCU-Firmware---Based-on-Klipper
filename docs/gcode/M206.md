# M206 - Set Home Offsets

Use M206 to apply a persistent offset to the native home position and coordinate space. This effectively shifts the coordinate space in the negative direction. 


### Notes

- The current position is adjusted to align to the new home offset values.
- The home offset is persistent â€” added to the current position until changed.
- Some uses include fine adjustment of Z position (without moving endstops) and shifting the coordinate space to print on a different part of the bed.


### Usage

``` M206 [X<offset>] [Y<offset>] [Z<offset>] ```

| Argument      | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `[X<offset>]` | X home offset. |
| `[Y<offset>]` | Y home offset. |
| `[Z<offset>]` | Z home offset. |


### Examples

Raise Z up a little bit on the first layer:

```
M206 Z-0.2
```

Shift the print area 10mm to the left:

```
M206 X10
```
