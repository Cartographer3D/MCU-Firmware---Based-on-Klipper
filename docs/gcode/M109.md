# M109 - Wait for Hotend Temperature

This command optionally sets a new target hot end temperature and waits for the target temperature to be reached before proceeding. If the temperature is set with S then `M109` waits only when heating. If the temperature is set with R then `M109` will also wait for the temperature to go down.


### Notes

- To set the hot end temperature and proceed without waiting, use `M104`. 


### Usage

``` M109  [T<index>] [S<temp>] ```

| Argument     | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `[T<index>]` | Heater index. |
| `[S<temp>]`  | Target temperature (wait for cooling or heating). |


### Example

Set 200 Degree Celcius on the first heater
