# G28 - Auto Home

Auto-home one or more axes, moving them towards their endstops until triggered. Each axis is backed off and re-bumped according to the `homing_retract_dist` parameter in the printerconfig file.


### Notes

Klippy requires you to home an axis before you can move it via a `G1/G0` command,


### Usage

``` G28 [X<pos>] [Y<pos>] [Z<pos>] ```

| Argument  | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `[X<pos>]` | Flag to go back to the X axis origin |
| `[Y<pos>]` | Flag to go back to the Y axis origin |
| `[Z<pos>]` | Flag to go back to the Z axis origin |


### Example

Go to origin on all axes
```
G28

Home the X and Z axes
```
